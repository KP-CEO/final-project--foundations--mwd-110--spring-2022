    <h2>Aboutüìñ</h2>
    <p>Aubrey Drake Graham "Drake" is a Canadian rapper, singer, songwriter, and actor. Drake first came to startdom in the teen soap Degrassi: The Next Generation in the role of Jimmy Brooks, a wheelchair-bound character he played for seven years.
      After leaving the show he became one of the biggest rappers on the planet after signing a deal with Lil Wayne's label Young Money Entertainment. He is rarely out of the headlines, founding his own label, OVO Sound, or fronting the NBA‚Äôs Toronto
      Raptors as the team's global ambassador.</p>
    <p>Born on October 24, 1986, in Toronto, Canada, Drake grew up with music in his blood. His father, Dennis Graham, was a drummer for the legendary rock 'n' roll star Jerry Lee Lewis. An uncle, Larry Graham, played bass for Sly and the Family
      Stone. Drake says that his mother, Sandi Graham, also hails from a "very musical" family ‚Äî his grandmother babysat Aretha Franklin. </p>
    <p>Drake's parents divorced when he was five years old, and he was raised by his mother in Forest Hill, an affluent and predominantly Jewish neighborhood in Toronto. He attended Jewish day school, had a Bar Mitzvah at age 13 and observed the
      Jewish High Holy Days with his mother. "My mom has always made Hanukkah fun," Drake recalls. "When I was younger, she gave cool gifts and she'd make latkes." Despite his Jewish upbringing, Drake says he felt isolated at Forest Hill Collegiate
      Institute, his virtually all-white people high school. He has said that "nobody understood what it was like to be Black and Jewish," but added that "being different from everyone else just made me a lot stronger."</p>
    <p>It was one of Drake's classmates at Forest Hill who gave him his start in the entertainment industry. "There was a kid in my class whose father was an agent," Drake would later explain, adding: "His dad would say, 'If there's anyone in the
      class that makes you laugh, have them audition for me.' After the audition, he became my agent." Drake dropped out of school to pursue his acting career, only graduating from high school in 2012. He starred on Degrassi for seven years
      (2001-2009), earning a Young Artist Award in 2002 for best ensemble in a TV series, among other honors. The show quickly developed a devoted cult following.</p>
    <p>While he was still appearing on Degrassi, Drake began attempting to cross over into the world of hip hop. He released his first mixtape, Room for Improvement, in 2006, achieving modest sales of approximately 6,000 copies. He followed that with
      the 2007 release of another mixtape, Comeback Season, on his own October‚Äôs Very Own imprint (later to be shortened to OVO). This included Drake's first hit single and music video, "Replacement Girl," which was featured as the New Joint of the
      Day on BET's popular hip-hop TV show 106 & Park. More significantly, the song contained a version of Brisco and Flo Rida‚Äôs "Man of the Year," which featured Lil Wayne. Drake decided to leave Wayne‚Äôs verses and hook intact while he provided the
      rest of the lyrics himself. This caught the attention of Jas Prince, son of Rap-A-Lot Records founder James Prince, who decided to play Drake to Lil Wayne himself.</p>
    <p>In 2008, the producers of Degrassi overhauled the cast, eliminating Drake's character. Drake was on the verge of looking for a day job. But early in 2008, he received an unexpected call from Lil Wayne, who asked him to board a flight to
      Houston that night to join his Carter III tour. After touring and recording a number of songs with Lil Wayne, Drake released his third mixtape, So Far Gone, in February 2009. It featured the infectious single "Best I Ever Had," which peaked at
      No. 2 on Billboard's Hot 100 singles chart, while "Successful," a collaboration with Wayne and Trey Songz, went gold and made Rolling Stone‚Äôs "25 Best Songs of 2009" list. Since then, Drake's barrage of catchy, R&B-infused hip hop songs have
      dominated radio airwaves. That was just the beginning, and it was only up from there!</p>
